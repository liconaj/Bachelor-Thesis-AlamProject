  abstract = { This paper describes a mechanism which has six degrees of freedom, controlled in any combination by six motors, each having a ground abutment. It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the new attitude. Variations in control arrangements are described and their respective design merits considered. Other possible uses for this mechanism are mentioned, including automation of production. }

Herein, these developments with a comprehensive review of existing continuum robots and emerging technologies are examined. Then, modeling and control approaches are compared, and navigation strategies exclusive to continuum robots, such as follow the leader, coiling, and circumnutation are examined.

Their potential to provide multi-degree-of-freedom articulation gives them versatility and makes them very useful in various applications. The purpose of this paper is to model a six link parallel continuum robot using the Cosserat theory. The single rod model is initially derived and experimentally verified with an average error of 12\%. Then, the parallel continuum robot model is obtained by combining six elastic links, and eventually, some experiments are done on a real system to analyze the results of the obtained model.}

  abstract = {Rod-driven Parallel Continuum Robots (PCR) are a class of continuum robots (CR) that possess the potential to combine advantages of parallel structure into CRs. However, rod-driven PCRs usually have a limited workspace due to the designed constraints, which restrict the exploitation of their potentials. This paper presents the design, statics modeling, and workspace analysis of a rod-driven PCR for extending its motion range. The proposed design has 5 degrees of freedom (DoFs) for manipulation by reasonably arranging constraints and kinematic pairs. We employ a known modeling method based on the Cosserat equations and a variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method to solve the model, making the PCR with multi-intermediate constraints approach real-time applications. The design's feasibility is experimentally verified on a developed prototype. We then present a numerical procedure for analyzing partial workspace efficiently. Our results highlight the design's feature to enlarge workspace, of which a set of configurations can reach about 64\% of the cube volume of max arm length, and an average of 4s solving spatial paths, with max errors of 2.5\% of max arm length.}

  abstract = { A reliable, accurate, and yet simple dynamic model is important to analyzing, designing, and controlling hybrid rigid--continuum robots. Such models should be fast, as simple as possible, and user-friendly to be widely accepted by the ever-growing robotics research community. In this study, we introduce two new modeling methods for continuum manipulators: a general reduced-order model (ROM) and a discretized model with absolute states and Euler-Bernoulli beam segments (EBA). In addition, a new formulation is presented for a recently introduced discretized model based on Euler--Bernoulli beam segments and relative states (EBR). We implement these models in a Matlab software package, named TMTDyn, to develop a modeling tool for hybrid rigid--continuum systems. The package features a new high-level language (HLL) text-based interface, a CAD-file import module, automatic formation of the system equation of motion (EOM) for different modeling and control tasks, implementing Matlab C-mex functionality for improved performance, and modules for static and linear modal analysis of a hybrid system. The underlying theory and software package are validated for modeling experimental results for (i) dynamics of a continuum appendage, and (ii) general deformation of a fabric sleeve worn by a rigid link pendulum. A comparison shows higher simulation accuracy (8--14\% normalized error) and numerical robustness of the ROM model for a system with a small number of states, and computational efficiency of the EBA model with near real-time performances that makes it suitable for large systems. The challenges and necessary modules to further automate the design and analysis of hybrid systems with a large number of states are briefly discussed. }

  abstract   = {We present a momentum conserving hybrid particle/grid iteration for resolving volumetric elastic collision. Our hybrid method uses implicit time stepping with a Lagrangian finite element discretization of the volumetric elastic material together with impulse-based collision-correcting momentum updates designed to exactly conserve linear and angular momentum. We use a two-step process for collisions: first we use a novel grid-based approach that leverages the favorable collision resolution properties of Particle-In-Cell (PIC) techniques, then we finalize with a classical collision impulse strategy utilizing continuous collision detection. Our PIC approach uses Affine-Particle-In-Cell momentum transfers as collision preventing impulses together with novel perfectly momentum conserving boundary resampling and downsampling operators that prevent artifacts in portions of the boundary where the grid resolution is of disparate resolution. We combine this with a momentum conserving augury iteration to remove numerical cohesion and model sliding friction. Our collision strategy has the same continuous collision detection as traditional approaches, however our hybrid particle/grid iteration drastically reduces the number of iterations required. Lastly, we develop a novel symmetric positive semi-definite Rayleigh damping model that increases the convexity of the nonlinear systems associated with implicit time stepping. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach in a number of collision intensive examples.},
