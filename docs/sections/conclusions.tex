Throughout this project, the development of the Alam robot platform has showcased the successful integration of mechanical design, control theory, and software development. The platform, constructed from steel rod segments and 3D-printed components, offers a robust framework for robotic experimentation and control. Despite challenges in firmware completion and electronic assembly, the platform achieved its primary goal of providing a flexible and programmable robotic system.

Testing and experimentation highlighted both achievements and areas for improvement in the Alam platform. The implementation of PID control algorithms demonstrated effective position control, though issues with overshoot and controller saturation necessitated further refinement. Challenges with linear actuators underscored the importance of precision manufacturing and iterative design enhancements. These insights inform future iterations aimed at optimizing performance and reliability.

In summary, the Alam robot platform serves as a foundational tool for exploring advanced robotics concepts and applications. By addressing challenges in mechanical design, control algorithms, and software integration, this project sets a precedent for future developments.
