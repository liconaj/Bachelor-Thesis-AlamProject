This project focuses on the design and development of a portable, modular, and scalable platform and control system for the actuation of rod-driven continuum parallel robots. The primary objective was to create a versatile mounting solution that enables the efficient movement of such robots in various applications. The platform facilitates the deployment and operation of the robots in diverse environments, providing flexibility and ease of use.

The project involved the design and construction of the mounting platform, as well as the development of the control interface. Additionally, a rod-driven continuum parallel robot was designed and implemented, with a focus on miniaturization and optimization of the structure. The novel approach involved wire structures interconnected by rings to restrict rod movement, with innovative ring joints designed to enhance stability and performance.
