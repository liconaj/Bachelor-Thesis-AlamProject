\par This project focuses on designing and implementing a portable, modular, and scalable platform alongside a control system tailored for rod-driven continuum parallel robots. The main goal was to develop a versatile mounting solution facilitating efficient robot movement across diverse applications. The project involved the design and construction of the mounting platform, as well as the development of the control interface. A rod-driven continuum parallel robot was designed and implemented, with a focus on miniaturization and optimization of the structure. Additionally, the project aimed to implement a customized language specification for programming the linear actuators, enabling tailored control and operational flexibility. Furthermore, an application was developed to interface with the control system, utilizing the created protocol to ensure seamless communication and precise control.
