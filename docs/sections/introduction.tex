This is the introduction.

\section{Objectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
To design and develop a portable, modular, and scalable platform with a control system for the actuation of rod-driven continuum parallel robots.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adapt an existing design of a rod-drive continuum parallel robot optimizing for size.
    \item Design linear actuators that provide precise control and dexterous movement.
    \item Fabricate the components and assemble a working physical prototype of the platform.
    \item Implement a customized language specification for programming the linear actuators.
    \item Develop an application to interface with the control system using the created protocol.
    \item Conduct experimental testing and validation of the system.
\end{itemize}
